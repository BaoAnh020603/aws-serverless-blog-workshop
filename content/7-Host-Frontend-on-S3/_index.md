#### Amazon S3

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an object storage service from AWS that allows storing and serving static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. In this project, S3 is used to host a React/Vite frontend application as a static website.

#### S3 in the Workshop
In this section, we will:
- Create an S3 bucket to store the static files of the frontend application (the `dist/` folder from step 6).

- Enable **Static website hosting** on S3.

- Upload static files from React/Vite projects.

- Configure public access so users can access the website.

#### Benefits of using S3:

- **Low cost**: Free Tier provides 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, and 2,000 PUT requests for free per month.

- **Easy to deploy**: Supports static website hosting, suitable for React/Vite applications.

- **Integrated with CloudFront**: Accelerates content delivery and supports HTTPS (step 8).

- **High durability**: Ensures data safety with 99.999999999% durability.

#### Create and configure S3 Bucket

1. **Access AWS Management Console**
- Find and select **S3** in AWS Console.

2. **Create S3 Bucket**

- In the **S3** interface, select **Buckets** â†’ **Create bucket**.

- **Bucket name**: Enter a unique name, for example: `blog-workshop-<your-account-id>`.

- **Region**: Select the same region as the API Gateway (for example: `us-east-1`).

- **Object Ownership**: Select **ACLs disabled**.

- **Block Public Access settings**: Keep the default (will be updated later).

- Click **Create bucket**.

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting**

- Open the bucket you just created, select the **Properties** tab.

- Scroll down to **Static website hosting**, select **Edit**.

- Select **Enable**.

- **Index document**: Enter `index.html`.

- Click **Save changes**.

- Save the **Bucket website endpoint** (e.g. `http://blog-workshop-<your-account-id>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`).

4. **Configure access rights**

- In the **Permissions** tab, select **Edit** under **Block public access**.
- Uncheck **Block all public access** and its sub-options, click **Save changes**.

- In **Bucket policy**, select **Edit** and add the following policy:
```json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:GetObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::blog-workshop-<your-account-id>/*"
}
]
}
```
- Click **Save changes**.

5. **Upload frontend files**

- In the `code/frontend/` folder (from step 6), run the build command if you haven't done so already:

```
cd code/frontend
npm run build
```

- In the bucket, select **Upload** and upload the entire `dist/` folder.

- Make sure all files (HTML, CSS, JS) are uploaded with the default **Content-Type**.

6. **Test the website**

- Visit the **Bucket website endpoint** in your browser (e.g. `http://blog-workshop-<your-account-id>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`).

- Check the post list and post creation form.

- If you encounter an error (e.g. 403 Forbidden):

- Check the bucket policy and public access.

- Verify the **Invoke URL** in `src/App.jsx` matches the API Gateway.

- Check the browser console logs or Lambda's CloudWatch Logs.

{{% notice warning %}}
The bucket name must be globally unique (add `<your-account-id>` to avoid duplicates).
Make sure the bucket policy allows `s3:GetObject` to be public.
Save the **Bucket website endpoint** for use in the CloudFront configuration step.

#### Done
- You've created an S3 bucket, enabled static website hosting, and uploaded your frontend application.
